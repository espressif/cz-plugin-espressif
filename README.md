## Introduction

This is a plugin for Commitizen that makes it easy to create and maintain a well-organized and good-looking `CHANGELOG.md`.

It also takes care of version bumping and helps you write commit messages that follow Espressif standards.

All of this with minimal config and setup, so your `pyproject.toml` file stays clean and simple.

---

## Install

Of course, you have already created and activated a Python virtual environment... then:

```sh
pip install czespressif
```

.... and add snippet from [Minimal setup](#minimal-setup) - that's it ü§ù.

You can also add it to your project `dev` dependencies (suggested) and run the sync command (`pipenv sync`, `pip-sync`, `poetry install`, ...).

Commitizen itself is in the plugin's dependencies, so pip will take care of everything.

> \[!WARNING\]
> Don't try to install it system-wide with `pipx`.
>
> This is a plugin, and that's probably not going to work as you expect.

### Build Changelog

If a changelog already exists in your project, make sure you have staged or committed its latest version.

This command turns your old changelog into a nicely organized template based on the Keep Changelog standard.

```sh
cz changelog
```

### Bump Release version

Is better to first run:

```sh
cz bump --dry-run
```

This only shows the future version and the part of the changelog that will be updated. When all ok, do the same without `--dry-run` flag.

### Write commit message

In case anyone actually prefers this way of creating commit messages, the command:

```sh
cz commit
```

in this plugin is aligned with the Espressif commit linter and DangerJS linters. You can give it a try...

```
? Select the type of change you are committing (Use arrow keys)
 ¬ª feat                     ‚ú® A new feature
   fix                      üêõ A bug fix
   change                   üèóÔ∏è A change made to the codebase.
   docs                     üìñ Documentation only change
   test                     üö¶  Adding missing or correcting existing tests
   ci                       ‚öôÔ∏è Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
   refactor                 üîß A changeset neither fixing a bug nor adding a feature
   revert                   üîô Revert one or more commits
   remove                   üóëÔ∏è Removing code or files
```

### Example

If you are unsure about the commit message standard, hit:

```sh
cz example

```

This will bring up a complete example of good commit messages and commit schema in the terminal.

---

## Configuration

Config is accepted in `pyproject.toml` (priority, following example), `.cz.toml`, `.cz.json`, `cz.json`, `.cz.yaml`, `cz.yaml`, and `cz.toml`.

### Minimal setup

> \[!TIP\]
> Try to be minimalistic with custom configs. The best approach is to keep the defaults, so all Espressif projects maintain the same look and feel.
> Also, you will save yourself troubles with non-standard setups.

```ini
[tool.commitizen]
   name            = "czespressif"
   bump_message    = 'change(bump): release $current_version ‚Üí $new_version [skip-ci]'
```

### Optimal setup

```ini
[tool.commitizen]
  name            = "czespressif"
  bump_message    = 'change(bump): release $current_version ‚Üí $new_version [skip-ci]'

  # see commitizen docs, following are standard configs
  annotated_tag = true
  changelog_merge_prerelease = true
  tag_format = "v$version"
  update_changelog_on_bump = true

```

### Additional configurable parameters

```ini
[tool.commitizen]
    ...

    # - Section emojis in the changelog, emojis in CLI command `cz commit` -
    # Default: true; false = do not display emojis
    # Note: Emojis are never added in the commit messages.

    changelog_header = "This is our changelog.\nAll cool things we do are here.\n\nPlease read it."

    # - Custom text of changelog footer -
    # Note: "" (empty string) disables footer
    changelog_footer = "This is the end of our changelog.\n\nMore cool things are coming."

    # - Horizontal lines between release sections in the changelog -
    # Default: true; false = removes lines
    changelog_section_line = false  # default (true); false = removes horizontal lines between releases

    # - Section "Unreleased" in the changelog -
    # Default: true; false = removes section Unreleased, keeps only releases
    changelog_unreleased = false

    # - Authors of the changes (commits) in the changelog -
    # Default: true; false = do not display authors
    changelog_show_authors = false

    # - Commit numbers (short SHA) in the changelog -
    # Default: true; false = do not display commit numbers
    changelog_show_commits = false

    # - Change orders in which sections displays in the changelog -

    ]

    # - Redefine which types are shown in the changelog -
    # Note: You need to list here ALL types that you want to have in the changelog - included default ones
    # Note: The order in this list doesn't matter ‚Äî if you want to change the sections' order too, use with "change_type_order."
    types_in_changelog = ["feat", "fix", "refactor", "style", "ci"]

    # - Add extra commit types for 'cz commit' and to the changelog (sections) -
    # Note: If you are working with custom commit types, ensure your commit linter and PR/MR linter is set same way
    [[tool.commitizen.extra_types]]
        type        = "style"
        heading     = "Code Style"
        emoji       = "üé®"
        description = "Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)"
        bump        = "PATCH"
        changelog   = true
```
