# Contributing and Development

We welcome contributions! To contribute to this repository, please follow these steps:

## Code and Testing

- **Code Style and Structure:**

- **Pre-Commit Hooks:** Install pre-commit hooks in this repository using the `pre-commit install` command.

- **Readable Code Structure:** Structure your code in a readable manner. The main logic should be in the default rule function, with implementation details in helper functions. Avoid nested `if` statements and unnecessary `else` statements to maintain code clarity and simplicity.

- **Remove Debug Statements:** Remove any development debug statements from your files.

- **Automated Tests:** We aim for full test coverage, so **partial tests will not be accepted**. The tests should cover all typical usage scenarios as well as edge cases to ensure robustness.

- **Testing Tool:** It is recommended to run `pytest` frequently during development to ensure that all aspects of your code are functioning as expected.

## Documentation and Maintenance

- **Changelog:** `CHANGELOG.md` is generated automatically by `commitizen` from commit messages. Not need to update `CHANGELOG.md` manually. Focus on informative and clear commit messages which end in the release notes.

- **Documentation:** Regularly check and update the documentation to keep it current.

- **PR/MR Descriptions and Documentation:** When making contributions, clearly describe any changes or new features in both the PR (Pull Request on GitHub) or MR (Merge Request on GitLab) description and the project documentation. If you're modifying the output style, please include a thumbnail of the new style.
